I built this simple calculator with only HTML, CSS nad Javascript. 
For now it can only compute calculations with two values and one operand at a time, you can also calculate roots, percentages and squaring of numbers.
I used CSS grid and Flexbox mostly fot the layout.
I used the DOM to accept and display values on the screen, Javascript functions to compute the values absed on which operand was used and other Javascript
methods to calculate the root and sqaures.
In a future update i plan to include the sine, cosine and tangent functions and well as computaion of multiple values with different operands all while obeying
the order of operations.
